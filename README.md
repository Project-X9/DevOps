# Prerequisites installations

**Please note that your ubuntu username is assumed to be "ubuntu"**

Update the database with information on any new packages
>sudo apt-get update

>sudo apt-get install -y build-essential openssl libssl-dev pkg-config


**Install node**
Install nodejs package

>sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Install npm package

>sudo apt-get install npm -y

Clean the data in the cache folder

>sudo npm cache clean -f

>sudo npm install -g n

Upgrade to the latest stable node version**

>sudo n stable

**Install nginx**

>sudo apt-get install nginx -y

**Install Git**

>sudo apt-get install git -y

**Install and setup mongoDB**

>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 4B7C549A058F8B6B

>echo deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list

>sudo apt install udo

>sudo apt-get update

>sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org 

>sudo systemctl enable mongod && sudo systemctl start mongod

**Install PM2**

>sudo npm install pm2 -g

**Install pip for python-3**
>sudo apt install python3-pip

**Install python3-distutils package**
>sudo apt-get install python3-distutils

**Install xvfb**
>sudo apt-get install xvfb

**Install Jenkins**
First, we need to install java JDK using the following commands
>sudo apt update

>sudo apt install default-jdk

Then, to install the latest version of Jenkins, we need to add the Jenkins repository key and then update our packages to be able to use the repository using the following commands
>wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -

>sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

>sudo apt-get update

Now, we can install Jenkins by simply running the following command
>sudo apt-get install jenkins

Finally, to allow Jenkins to perform commands using sudo, we need to run the following command
>sudo visudo

and then append this line to the end 
>jenkins ALL= (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

And then save to sudoers (not sudoers.tmp)

Now, Jenkins should be running on port 8080, but you need the initial admin password to be able to access it for the first time, before you set your own username and password.
To get the password, run the following command
>sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

And now the password will be written on your terminal




# Complete steps documentation
### After installing the previous tools, we need to do the following:
**Set the environment variables**
Run this command
> sudo nano /etc/environment

Then append the following lines:
PORT="3000" 

MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://admin:admin@projectx-test-d5geh.mongodb.net/projectx?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

NODE_ENV="production"

Then press ctrl+o to save, then ctrl+x to exit the editor

Make sure that you logout of the remote server and ssh back in after you do so, in order for the environment variables to get set


**Clone the repo**
Simply run the following commands to clone them into the /opt directory (or cd into any directory you want and clone it there)

>cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/Project-X9/BackEnd.git
cd /opt
sudo git clone -b features https://github.com/Project-X9/FrontEnd.git


**Linking the project wit Nginx**
Run the following commands
>sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Then we edit the nginx config file as shown in the IMPORTANTGUIDLINES.txt file
Then restart nginx using the following command
>sudo systemctl restart nginx

**Installing dependencies**
Go to the directory in which you cloned the Backend repo, and install the dependencies by running the following commands:
>cd /opt
sudo chown -R ubuntu BackEnd
cd BackEnd
sudo npm install

Then go to the directory of the cloned Frontend repo, and install their dependencies using the following commands:
>cd /opt/FrontEnd/spotify
sudo npm install

Then create a build directory with a production build of the app using the following command:
>sudo npm run build

**Starting the backend api**

First, run the backend server using pm2

>cd /opt/BackEnd/src
pm2 start index.js --watch

To make pm2 start automatically when the server is rebooted, run the following two  commands:

>pm2 startup

>sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u ubuntu --hp /home/ubuntu

Then save the list of processes you want to start when the server starts

>pm2 save

**Now we need to setup two other directories which will contain the Back end and the Front end files, as these will be needed in Jenkins to run tests before deployment.**

The second backend api will run on port 5000, while the frontend files will be served using nginx, and they will be served on port 4000.

**Clone the repo**
Simply run the following commands to clone the backend and frontend repos 

>cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads

>sudo git clone -b devops https://github.com/Project-X9/BackEnd.git

>cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads

>sudo git clone -b Deployed https://github.com/Project-X9/FrontEnd.git

**Installing dependencies**

Go to the directory in which you cloned the backend repo for the second time, and install the dependencies using the following commands
>cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads

>sudo chown -R ubuntu BackEnd

>cd BackEnd

>npm install

Then go to the directory in which you cloned the frontend repo for the second time, and install the dependencies using the following commands
>cd /home/omar/Downloads/FrontEnd/spotify

>sudo npm install

>sudo npm run build

**Starting the second backend api**
We will start the second backend api on port 5000 this time using the following commands

>cd /home/omar/Downloads/BackEnd/src

We will set the PORT environment variable to be equal to 5000 temporarily (for this terminal session only), and then we will start the backend api. This way, it will run on port 5000.

>export PORT=5000

>pm2 start index.js --watch

Then save the list of processes you want to start when the server starts

>pm2 save


**Clone the Testing repo**
Now we want to clone the Testing repo, in order to be able to run these tests using Jenkins later on.

First, we will clone the repo using the following commands
>cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads

>git clone -b DevOpsB https://github.com/Project-X9/Testing.git

**Installing the Testing dependencies**
To install the testing dependencies, simply run the following command
>cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads/Testing

>python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

You then need to run one of the tests, in order to generate the geckodriver log file, as it has some permission restrictions the first time it is generated, which will cause Jenkins to not be able to run the tests, so we will generate it by running a simple test case, and then modify its permissions as follows

>python3 -m pytest ./Web_Testing/Tests/test_changePassword.py -m Do

>chmod 777 geckodriver.log









## Files needed for deployment
Nginx configuration file:


server {

listen 80 default_server;

server_name _;


location / {

root /opt/FrontEnd/spotify/build;

try_files $uri /index.html;

}


location /api/ {

proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;

}

}

server {

listen 4000;

server_name _;


location / {

root /home/ubuntu/Downloads/FrontEnd/spotify/build;

try_files $uri /index.html;

}


location /api/ {

proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;

}

}

# Credentials to access the server using ssh

To connect the the EC2 instance, you'll need a private key (.pem) file, and you'll need the username and the public DNS of the server.
For our server, the username is "ubuntu", and the public DNS is  "ec2-3-21-218-250.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com".
So, if you have the necessary .pem file required to ssh into the server, you'll need to go into the directory containing this .pem file, and then you can ssh into the server using the following command:
>ssh -i "mypem.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-21-218-250.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

assuming that your pem file name is "mypem.pem"
