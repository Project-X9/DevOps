- Please note that the CI task has been done locally, and not on the EC2 instance, after taking the TA's permission, because the
remote server had issues with it's CPU Utilization and RAM, and would freeze when Jenkins would try to build the Front-End Files, so the
CI task has been performed locally after being granted this permission.
