- Please note that the CI task has been done locally, and not on the EC2 instance, after taking the TA's permission, because the
remote server had issues with it's CPU Utilization and RAM, and would freeze when Jenkins would try to build the Front-End Files, so the
CI task has been performed locally after being granted this permission.

- Also, please note that, since the CI task has been done locally, I used Ngrok to be able to access my localhost through the internet,
in order to be able to set the webhooks in the BackEnd, FrontEnd, and Testing repositories. However, the public address given by Ngrok is
no longer valid once you close the terminal on which the Ngrok command has been issued, so I removed the webhooks, and only left one in the
BackEnd repository just to prove I used webhooks, but you will ofcourse notice that it will say that the "Last delivery was not
successful", as this webhook is no longer valid.
