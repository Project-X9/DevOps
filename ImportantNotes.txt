- Please note that the CI task has been done locally, and not on the EC2 instance, after taking the TA's permission, because the 
remote server had issues with it's CPU Utilization and RAM, and would freeze when Jenkins would try to build the Front-End Files, so the 
CI task has been performed locally after being granted this permission. 

- Also, please note that, since the CI task has been done locally, I used Ngrok to be able to access my localhost through the internet, 
in order to be able to set the webhooks. However, the public address given by Ngrok is no longer valid once you close the terminal on which
the Ngrok command has been issued.
